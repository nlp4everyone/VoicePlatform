    Factory class for creating ASR recognizer instances.

        Create a recognizer instance based on the specified model.
        
        This method creates the appropriate recognizer instance with the
        specified device configuration. Model validation is handled by the
        recognizer class, which rejects unsupported models.
        
        Args:
            model_name (str): Identifier of the recognizer model to create.
            device (Literal["cuda","cpu","auto"]): Device to use for inference.
                                                   "auto" automatically selects CUDA if available.

        Note:
            This method maintains a singleton pattern - only one recognizer
            instance is stored at a time. Subsequent calls will replace the
            previous instance.
